To Whom it May Concern:

I am beyond excited in applying to work starting summer of 2023! I am 
currently a third-year pursuing a Specialist in Mathematics with Physics applications 
with a minor in Chemistry and Computer Science at the University of Toronto-Trinity College.
Besides my main studies in Mathematics and Physics, I have completed multiple courses 
in computer science as well as gained experience in and outside of class.
\par In the summer of 2022, I had the opportunity to work as a Software 
Engineer at Promise Robotics for 4 months in creating more affordable, 
sustainable, and safe houses through automating construction. The work that I did 
would help fulfill a million job shortage in construction as well as prevent the housing shortage. 
I utilized \bold{Python, Django, Docker, Machine Learning, Open CASCADE,
IfcOpenShell, CAD, databases, and applied Physics} in this hands-on 
robotics experience. At work, I was able to have an intimate experience
with the CEO, other executive members, and engineers of many other 
disciplines that allowed me to broaden my learnings as well as understand 
aspects of a business. Besides that, I am a senior technologist strategist
for Blue Sky Solar Racing Team at the University of Toronto. I conduct
solar cell research (optics and bifacial cells), fabricate, and create
simulations \bold{(Matlab, Python, Parallel Computing \& CAD)} to 
optimize the performance and design of a solar car, to be raced in 
the American and World Solar Competition.  I am also on the optics 
team of the University of Toronto Aerospace Team Space System Division 
where I do numerical analysis (Python) and research for optics 
(holographic gratings) of our satellite payload. A recent project
of mine that I developed was a friend-making webapp called Amigos 
using \bold{Java, Javascript, CSS, and HTML.} \par In a humble sense,
I have some skills but I more importantly have an aptitude for 
learning that I would like to demonstrate to you. I am a well-rounded person that 
speaks 4 languages, plays 3 instruments, and played 2 varsity sports
 (wrestling and track). \par
Overall, I would like to state that:

-I have the \bold{Skills:} I am a critical thinker and eager learner with mastery in
\bold{Python, Java, and MATLAB}. I am also currently working towards mastering
\bold{C and C++} and am working towards a Self Driving Car 4-Course Specialization
through the University of Toronto.\par

-I have the \bold{Passion:} I spend the bulk of my free time curiously learning 
on the internet and talking to friends in the field. All part of the fun!\par
-I have the \bold{Character:} I am a lighthearted guy. I love people and I do 
hope people love me too. :)
